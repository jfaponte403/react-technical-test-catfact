# Fetch Cat Fact
##  Technical test 

This is a technical test I received, inspired by a challenge from [Midudev](https://youtu.be/XYpadB4VadY?si=qtmGFJ80y-w8bkD2).

### Test

```
APIs:
Random Fact: https://catfact.ninja/fact
Random Image: https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello

Instructions:
Retrieve a random cat fact from the first API.
Extract the first word from the fact.
Display an image of a cat with the first word on it.
```

For this test I have created the project from cero without using `npm create vite`, this test it's from vanilla 
HTML and TypeScript, and that is the principal different, Midudev use for this test JS and I have use Typescript
